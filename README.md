# Forum GO Project Overview

The Forum was a one-month project challenging us to exploit several features of the Go, HTML, JS & SQL languages. We had to learn to solve various problems on the languages ‚Äã‚Äãused as well as with Docker. We explored the libraries through additional features and learned how to use containerization

## Technologies

### Front-End

- **HTML** : For page structure
- **CSS**: For page styling
- **JS**: For dynamic pages and effects

### Back-End

- **Golang**: For all routes, registrations & SQL queries
- **SQL Lite**: For everything related to data storage

## Features

- **Connection via multiple networks via their APIs**: Google, GitHub, Facebook, 
- **Creation of posts, topics**: Being able to create posts in different categories with tags
- **Commentary, Like & Dislikes**: Being able to add comments, add a like or a dislike to the post you are viewing IF you are connected
- **Images Upload**: Store images in SQL and be able to display them in the topics
- **Admin Page**: An admin page which allows you to manage users, delete them for example or even change their roles but also see the posts reported by the moderators to be able to accept or delete them




## Additional Features

- **Discord Login**: We added discord to the basic request options to add complexity
- **Tags**: Being able to add tags to your topics

## Getting Started


To get the project up and running, make sure you have a Go & Docker environment configured on your machine. Follow these steps to install and launch the project:

### Prerequisites

- [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) : It must be installed on your machine as well as in your environment variables if you are under Windows
- [Go 1.21m](https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.12.src.tar.gz)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) : You must have docker if you want to launch with it you can launch the project without but this is not recommended because the db will not work

### Installation and Execution

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayzx/Challenge-JS/
